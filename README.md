This repository provides a python script that can automatically download datasets from Metoffice's Had-UK website (https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/4dc8450d889a491ebb20e724debe2dfb).

Users can specify time-series type, grid scale and time-step.

I will add a script to read the netcdf files and average them over user-provided shapefiles hopefully before Christmas 2019.
