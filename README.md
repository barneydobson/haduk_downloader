# haduk_downloader
This repository provides a python script that can automatically download datasets from Metoffice's Had-UK website (https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/4dc8450d889a491ebb20e724debe2dfb). This dataset contains gridded estimates of historic climate data that covers the entire UK.

Users can specify time-series type, grid scale and time-step.

Users can also aggregate the downloaded data over a specified shapefile.
